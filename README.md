## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I took advantage of this project to practice the use of **Flexbox**:

Smooth transition of sizes

```css
main {
  transition: width .4s, height .4s;
  transition-timing-function: ease;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to improve the use of **Flexbox** in conjunction with media queries.
